# 3-Body Problem Simulation

An interactive simulation of the three-body problem in physics, implemented in JavaScript using HTML5 Canvas.

## Features

- Real-time simulation of three celestial bodies interacting through gravity
- Interactive controls to adjust planet mass and size
- Drag and drop to reposition planets before starting the simulation
- Adjustable simulation speed
- Beautiful visual trails showing the planets' paths

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. Use the sliders to adjust planet properties
4. Drag planets to position them
5. Click "Start" to begin the simulation

## Controls

- **Speed Slider**: Adjust the simulation speed
- **Planet Settings**:
  - Size: Changes the visual size of the planet
  - Mass: Adjusts the planet's mass and gravitational pull
- **Buttons**:
  - Start/Pause: Toggle the simulation
  - Reset: Return to initial state

## Technical Details

- Built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas
- Implements Newton's law of universal gravitation
- Uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
